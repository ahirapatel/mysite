			<h3>Things To Do</h3>
			<hr class="borderattr" />

			<p>
				Learn <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Use <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation">
				Twitter + API</a> for something. I have used it before, and it
				is quite the nice information source.
			</p>

			<p>
				Make a screen magnifier. Many exist, but I want to make one
				myself.
			</p>

			<p>
				Learn how to judge strings as being "similar" and make some
				sort of fuzzy search.
			</p>

			<p>
				Make a basic game. Then add local co-op. Then add online co-op.
				Then add a chat.
			</p>

			<p>
				Make a pretend stock simulator. Get actual stock prices from
				the internet. Give user choice to buy and sell stocks, and have
				the ability to bring up how much the user made. Have a history
				with user's purchases and profits. Store data in SQLite.
				<br />
				<strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Learn how stocks actually work.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also attempt to tack on some machine learning to the stock
				simulator to try to help you predict when and what to buy and
				sell. Initial research suggests that this will be pretty much
				impossible and doomed to fail.
				<br />
				<strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Learn how to make machine
				learning models, better statistics knowledge.
			</p>

			<p>
				My parents own a hotel, so make them something to manage
				customers, employees, finances, and reservations with.
				Definitely give it a nice GUI. It would be important to
				learn security practices or just not to include desirable
				information like credit card information.
